# Breeze


Laravel Breeze is basically an authentication starter kit.

It gives you the ready-made login, registration, password reset, email verification flows.

It wires up the routes, controllers, database migrations, and views for those auth features.


If later you want more advanced features (like team management, API tokens, profile photos, 2FA), then you’d look at Jetstream or Fortify.


- Fortify → backend auth logic only (no UI).
- Breeze → Fortify + simple auth templates (lightweight starter kit).
- Jetstream → Fortify + advanced templates & features (heavy starter kit).
