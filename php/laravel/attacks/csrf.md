# CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)


It‚Äôs an attack that send a request to a website without user consent.

## Scenario:

- Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre logged in to your bank‚Äôs website https://mybank.com .. notice: your browser stores a session cookie for mybank

- You then visit http://evil.com in another tab

- In Malicious Site `<img src="https://mybank.com/transfer?to=attacker&amount=1000" />` which Sends a Hidden Request .. 

- Browser automatically sends your request to mybank.com along with the session cookie

- If mybank.com‚Äôs transfer endpoint doesn‚Äôt verify authenticity, the request goes through. üí∏ Money transferred without you ever clicking anything on mybank.com.

## It‚Äôs because:
- Browsers automatically include cookies for the target site with every request.
- The site trusts those cookies as proof of authentication.
- The attacker exploits that trust.


## How To Prevent

### CSRF Tokens

Every form or state-changing request with your application includes a random secret token.

```html
<form method="POST" action="/transfer">
  <input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="ABC123XYZ">
  <input type="text" name="amount">
  <button>Send</button>
</form>
```

The server checks: Does the token match what was stored in the session? If not ‚Üí reject the request.

This prevents forged requests, since the attacker‚Äôs site can‚Äôt know the secret token.

CSRF Token is generated in start of each session as `_token=>asvzxbasseqwe123` and it regenerate whenever session regenerate .. when user first view there is a session and when he login session regenerate and when logout session regenerate etc..

Server send the token: 
- cookie `XSRF-TOKEN` so clients can use it 
- with php method `csrf_token()`

client send the token: 
- `_token` request parameter
- `X-CSRF-TOKEN` request header


### SameSite Cookies

Modern browsers support a cookie attribute called SameSite. This tells the browser: Don‚Äôt send this cookie with cross-site requests.

`Set-Cookie: session=xyz; SameSite=Lax`

Lax: send cookie only when user actioned directly like clicked a button or a link (default in laravel). So it blocks many CSRF attacks, especially those using hidden forms, <img> tags, and automatic GET requests.
- Visiting https://yourbank.com ‚Üí cookie sent ‚úÖ
- External site <img src="https://yourbank.com/..."> ‚Üí cookie not sent ‚ùå
- Clicking a link from another site to your site ‚Üí cookie is sent ‚úÖ

Strict: never sends cookies on cross-site requests

None: Required if your site needs to send cookies in cross-site requests


Q: why not to use samesite = strict .. what are the use cases i may need this as lax?

- Email links or shared links.. User clicks a link from Gmail or a Slack message: https://example.com/dashboard .. Browser will not send cookies, so the user may be forced to log in again.

- OAuth / SSO redirects: If your site integrates with Google/Facebook login: OAuth redirects are cross-site requests, so cookies won‚Äôt be sent ‚Üí session lost or login fails.

Why Lax is usually chosen: Lax balances security and usability.

Use cases for Strict Highly sensitive apps where any cross-site request is unacceptable, e.g.: Admin dashboards for critical systems .. Banking apps with extra layers of CSRF protection

### Same Origin Policy and CORS

Same-Origin Policy (SOP): by default, browsers block JS from reading responses from different origins.

CORS: allows the server to say, ‚ÄúYes, this other origin is allowed to read my data.‚Äù

Request `Origin: https://evil.com` ..  

Response `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://evil.com` or `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`

Tip: browser considers each subdomain a different origin.

partially solve it because CORS dont block requests completely.. only JS reading the response is blocked. So CSRF can still succeed even if your CORS policy is strict.


### Use POST (Not GET) for State-Changing Actions

then malicious site can't do this <a href="/transfer?to=attacker&amount=1000">Transfer</a>

partially solve it, because malicious site can send ajax request with post method


### Check the Origin or Referer Header

Check the Origin or Referer Header

When a browser send a request it include header Origin: https://yourbank.com or Referer: https://yourbank.com/account

Partially solve it, because malicious site still can forgery the origin header while he is sending his request

```php

$origin = $_SERVER['HTTP_ORIGIN'] ?? $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'] ?? '';
if (!str_starts_with($origin, 'https://yourbank.com')) {
    http_response_code(403);
    exit('Invalid origin');
}

```
