//idea: define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.

//- strategy: is the algorithm
//- context: is the class which need the strategy to work


// Letâ€™s say you have an e-commerce app. Customers can pay with Credit Card, PayPal, or Bitcoin.
// If you donâ€™t use Strategy, youâ€™d end up with a big if/else inside your payment service.
