# HTTPS

HTTPS = HTTP over TLS/SSL.

TLS is the security protocol, its main idea is 
1- share symmetric key between client and server without man in middle can see this symmetric key
2- client should be confident he is talking to server and there is no one in the middle acting as the server

## TLS 1.3 (Key Exchange)
Client:
- generate private key a
- compute public key g^a mod p (classic DH)
-> [Request] Client Sends the public key to server 

Server:
- generates private key b
- Computes public key g^(b) mod p
-> [Response] Server Sends the public key back to the client.


Client computes: (server_public)^a = (g^(b) mod p) ^a = g^(ab) mod p
Server computes: (client_public)^b = (g^(a) mod p) ^b = g^(ab) mod p
Both sides arrive at the same secret g^(ab) mod p


To Add Entropy for uniqueness
- when client send his request, he send a random nonce.. server do the same when he respond
- on both end, tls specification provide HKDF (hash key deriving function) which takes (shared_key,client random,server random) and return the secret key which they are going to use for going forward encryption


please notice:
- (p and g) are prime numbers hardcoded in tls specifications. so client and server agree them from the start
- (1 RTT round trip time) is enough to have client and server can agree on the shared key 



## Q: it seems tls1.3 is generating private key and public key every session?

TLS 1.3 removed RSA key exchange completely.
Now all key exchange is (Elliptic Curve) Diffieâ€“Hellman (DH/ECDH).
- Both browser and server generate fresh, random private values every handshake (ephemeral keys).
- They exchange the corresponding public values.
- They compute a shared secret using Diffieâ€“Hellman math.
- From that secret, they derive session keys (with HKDF).
ðŸ‘‰ This gives forward secrecy: even if the serverâ€™s private key is stolen tomorrow, past traffic canâ€™t be decrypted.


### Client Should Be Confident of the server:
because someone in middle can act as the server and trick the client, there become a need to assure server responding is the correct server.

what we can do
- server can hold private and public key
- server can sign the data being sent to client with private key (CertificateVerify) and send the public key as well
- browser can use the public key to double check CertificateVerify to make sure all good

still even with the top implemented, a man in the middle can have his own combination of private key and public key and act as if he is the server

what we can do
- we need a certificate authority which will say example.com have this public key
- the certificate authority will make sure you are the domain owner when you try to issue a certificate from them


### Certificate
- A long-lived data structure, usually X.509.
- Issued by a Certificate Authority (CA).
Contains:
    -- The serverâ€™s public key.
    -- Information like subject name, domain name, validity period, extensions.
    -- The CAâ€™s digital signature over all of the above.
Purpose: prove that this public key belongs to the serverâ€™s domain name.


### Certificate Usage 
- so now, server can send the certificate with the response
- client will take the certificate 
    -- confirm ca is correct and listed on client list as trusted authority 
    -- confirm ca certificate signature is correct and do belong to ca
    -- confirm certificate declares domain name correct
    -- take the server public key from the certificate and use it to double check CertificateVerify to make sure all good
