# S3 Simple Storage Service

It’s a cloud-based storage service by AWS that lets you store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere.


### Bucket

A container that holds your files.

Each bucket has a unique name (globally across AWS).

Example:
my-company-backups, app-logs, user-uploads


### Object
- The actual file you store in S3.
- Each object has:
    - Key (path) — the object’s name, e.g. photos/2025/marsa.jpg
    - Data — the file content
    - Metadata — extra info (e.g., file type, owner, permissions)


### Region

Buckets live in specific AWS Regions (like us-east-1 or eu-west-1).

You choose the region for data proximity, performance, or compliance.


### Permissions

S3 has multiple layers of access control:

- Bucket policy → define access for all objects in the bucket.
- IAM policies → define what users or services can do.
- ACLs → (legacy) per-object or per-bucket access lists. (recommended to disable)
- Public access settings → protect you from accidentally making data public.

Tip: one bucket one policy .. one policy though can have multiple statements

Tip: by default, Amazon S3 automatically replicates your objects across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) within the same AWS Region.


| Key Feature             | Description                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Durability**          | 99.999999999% (11 nines!) — your data is extremely safe.                                |
| **Availability**        | 99.99% uptime — highly reliable.                                                        |
| **Replication**         | by default, data replicated across multiple (AZs) within the same Region.               |
| **Scalability**         | Indefinte Storage Hard disk                                                             |
| **Low cost**            | Pay only for what you use (GB/month + requests).                                        |
| **Security**            | data is encrypted by default on the disk                                                |
| **Versioning**          | if switched on, you can Keeps multiple versions of the same file.                       |
| **Lifecycle rules**     | you can Move old files with low requests to cheaper storage (e.g., Glacier).            |
| **Event notifications** | Trigger Lambda or SNS when new files are uploaded.                                      |


| Storage Class                          | Use Case                                                    |

| **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**             | Automatically moves files between tiers based on usage      |
| **S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)** | Cheaper, for rarely accessed data                           |
| **S3 Glacier**                         | Very cheap, for archives (retrieval may take minutes/hours) |
| **S3 Glacier Deep Archive**            | Cheapest, for long-term backup (e.g. 10 years)              |



### Policy Example


```json
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Sid": "Statement1",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Principal": "*",
			"Action": [
				"s3:GetObject",
				"s3:ListBucket"
			],
			"Resource": [
				"arn:aws:s3:::devopshero-test-bucket01",
				"arn:aws:s3:::devopshero-test-bucket01/*"
			]
		}
	]
}
```

Tip: resource can't be *, bucket policy require you define your current bucket resource arn

Tip: Resource should be arn:aws:s3:::devopshero-test-bucket01/* if you will action s3:GetObject

Tip: Action and Resource can be such as "Action": "S3:GetObject" , or in array as above



### S3 UseCases:


#### Backup and Archiving

Store system backups, database dumps, or logs.

Automatically move old backups to cheaper storage (like S3 Glacier).

Example:

Nightly MySQL backups → s3://company-backups/2025/11/13.sql

Retain 90 days in Standard, then archive with lifecycle rules.


#### Static Website Hosting

Host static content (HTML, CSS, JS, images) directly from S3.

Optional: use CloudFront CDN + Route 53 for a domain name.

`https://my-website-bucket.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com`


#### User uploads

Apps (web or mobile) can store user files: images, videos, PDFs.

S3 handles large files easily and scales automatically.

Often used with pre-signed URLs to let users upload securely.

✅ Example:
A social media app where users upload profile pictures → stored in S3.


### Machine Learning & AI

Store large datasets (images, text, logs) for ML training.

S3 integrates directly with SageMaker, EMR, and Glue.

✅ Example:
A company training a model on terabytes of product images stored in S3.


### Compliance & Governance

S3 supports versioning, MFA Delete, and Object Lock (write-once-read-many).

Great for regulatory requirements (HIPAA, GDPR, SEC 17a-4, etc.).

✅ Example:
Financial institutions store audit logs in S3 with WORM protection.
