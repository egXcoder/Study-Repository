# OOP .. Object Oriented Programming

## Procedural vs OOP

To build a cake
Procedural way is to do in sequence of steps
//Step 1
//Step 2 
// Step 3
Return cake;

Oop way:
Declare mixer
Declare oven
Declare pan
Use the three objects to build a cake


Procedural way is quicker and straight forward, but oop way is far better in the future because of code reusability, using the oop way i can build pie using pan and mixer and oven
