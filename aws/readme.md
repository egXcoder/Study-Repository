#### Resource
- Any Thing you can create in aws is called resource such as (user, policy, ec2, s3, ...)
- ARN (Amazon Resource Number) is assigned for any created resource and this number is unique through all aws




Practice:
- add iam users with groups and policies
- build ec2 instance
- build launch templates for ec2
- build s3
- build elastic load balancer
