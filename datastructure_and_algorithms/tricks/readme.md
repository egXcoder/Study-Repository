# Algorithms and DataStructure Tricks

- sum of arithmetic sequence from a1 to a2 = .5 * n * (a1+a2)

- sum of arithmetic sequence from 1 to n = .5 * n * (n+1)

- any number XOR with itself cancels out 5^6^5 = 6 .. you can refer back to problem 1

- you can know if number is even by bitwise operation num & 1






- Problems:
1. Given an integer array, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
