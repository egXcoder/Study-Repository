# Parking Lot Design


## [Problem](./parts/problem.md)

A parking lot is a designated area for parking vehicles, commonly found in venues like shopping malls, sports stadiums, and office buildings. It consists of a fixed number of parking spots allocated for different types of vehicles. Each spot is charged based on the duration a vehicle remains parked. Parking time is tracked using a parking ticket issued at the entrance. Upon exit, the customer can pay using either an automated exit panel or through a parking agent, with a credit/debit card or cash as accepted payment methods.
