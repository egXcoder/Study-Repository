# OOP .. Object Oriented Programming

## Procedural vs OOP

To build a cake
Procedural way is to do in sequence of steps
//Step 1
//Step 2 
// Step 3
Return cake;

Oop way:
Declare mixer
Declare oven
Declare pan
Use the three objects to build a cake


Procedural way is quicker and straight forward, but oop way is far better in the future because of code reusability, using the oop way i can build pie using pan and mixer and oven


## Cohesion vs Coupling

Cohesion â†’ how focused a class is internally.
Coupling â†’ how much modules rely on each other externally.
ðŸ‘‰ Good design aims for high cohesion (each class does one thing well) and low coupling (class donâ€™t heavily depend on each other, they depend to contract/interface not concrete implementation or pass value as paramter instead of passing whole class).

notice: high cohesion doesnt automatically lead to loose couple, they are two different dimensions and you should fight for both separately


## Interfaces

- Interfaces represent contract 
- interfaces must have methods as public. they can't have private/or protected methods
