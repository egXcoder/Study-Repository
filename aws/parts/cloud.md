# Cloud 

is providing all IT services over internet, it is like providing data center for rent, take what you need


### Infrastructure
- Servers (virtual or physical)
- Networking: connect servers via VPCs, subnets, and firewalls
- Cooling, power, and maintenance to ensure high availability (~99%)
- External storage that can be attached dynamically to any server
- Public IPs to expose servers and services to the Internet

### Application
- Ready-to-use databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, DynamoDB, etc.)
- ElasticSearch, Redis, and other caching/search services
- Message queues (SQS, RabbitMQ, etc.)
- Serverless functions (Lambda) for scheduled or event-driven tasks
- Monitoring and alerting over your infrastructure and apps (CloudWatch, etc.)
