//idea: when you have multiple ways to do the same thing, define each way in a class

// you would use strategy for:
// - when you have multiple ways to something
// - you want to switch between these algorithms dynamically in run time
// - alternatively, you can have big class like SortingAlgorithms and within you can declare methods, each method
//  define one sorting algorithm, but you end up with big object that doing multiple things (Violating SRP)
//  also change frequently if to add/edit sorting algorithm (violating OCP)
//  you can do it though for small project but while your project growing up
//  you will start feel the rigidity and you will refactor it to strategy pattern 


//- strategy: is the algorithm
//- context: is the class which need the strategy to work


// Letâ€™s say you have an e-commerce app. Customers can pay with Credit Card, PayPal, or Bitcoin.
// If you donâ€™t use Strategy, youâ€™d end up with a big if/else inside your payment service.
