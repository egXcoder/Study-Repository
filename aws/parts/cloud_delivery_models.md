# Cloud Delivery Models

for application to run we need some layers to exist and work
- Applications
- Databases
- RunTime
- OS
- Virtualization
- Servers
- Storage
- Networking

## On Premises

Developer control all of them


## IaaS Infrastructure as a service

Cloud will provide you infrastructure and you manage the linux/windows box

Cloud will be responsibile for
- OS (give you options of os and you choose one of them to install on your servers correctly)
- Virtualization 
- Servers (provide servers for you with cpu and memory then its ready to host os)
- Storage (ssd drivers and if its about to corrupt, they would move your data to another ssd disk and destroy the old one)
- Networking (wires between nodes is wired as you have configured and you wont get issue like cable unplugged)

and you as a developer you would responsible for
- Applications
- Databases
- RunTime

## PaaS Platform as a service

cloud can offer you runtime as well. for example if your application is a java application. you can ask the cloud straight away to give you java runtime then you dont have to manage the linux box

in this cloud can offer 
- RunTime

## SaaS Software as a service

saas means, you have the software there already and you can just use it like sap b1, odoo, xero,etc...

saas mostly refer to your software you are building as a developer

its rare that cloud provide saas, as its mostly your job as a developer to do the application + your database

in this cloud can offer
- Applications
- Databases
- RunTime
