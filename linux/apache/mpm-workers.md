# Apache MPM Workers (Multi-Processing Modules Workers)


## Know current MPM
`apachectl -V` know current mpm


## Available Workers
Apache has different MPMs that define how it handles concurrency:
- prefork ‚Üí processes only, no threads (old, safe for non-thread-safe PHP).
- worker ‚Üí multiple processes, each with multiple threads.
- event ‚Üí like worker, but with smarter handling of idle keep-alive connections.

## Prefork
- Request -> Process

### Bottlenecks in Prefork
- Memory Usage
    - Each process is a full copy of Apache + modules + PHP interpreter.
    - If you have MaxRequestWorkers 200, that‚Äôs 200 heavyweight processes in memory.
    - üëâ Example:
    If one process ~50MB,
    200 processes = 10GB RAM.
    That‚Äôs huge compared to Worker/Event (which use threads).

- Concurrency
    - Prefork cannot serve more requests concurrently than the number of processes.
    - If MaxRequestWorkers = 50, only 50 users get responses simultaneously.
    - Extra requests pile up in the backlog queue (OS queue).

- CPU Overhead
    - Context switching between many processes is expensive.

- Slow with Keep-Alive
    - Prefork wastes a process for the entire Keep-Alive duration.
    - A client holding an idle connection (waiting between requests) ties up a whole process doing nothing.


### Architecture 
- auto spawn 5 processes at startup (StartServers = 5)
- always keep at least 5 processes to serve incoming requests (MinSpareServers = 5)
- dont keep more than 10 processes idle (MaxSpareServers = 10)
- dont serve more than 150 requests (MaxRequestWorkers = 150)
- when request finish and (MaxRequestsPerChild = 0) then process terminate .. if another value then process get back to pool

Tip: if we got traffic more than 150, linux kernel will keep it in queue which need to be delivered to the socket.. if os queue becomes full.. user may see ‚ÄúConnection reset by peer‚Äù or ‚ÄúService unavailable‚Äù



## Event MPM
4 Processes + Each Process have 25 threads


### Why Event Better than Prefork
- Thread-based ‚Üí much lighter than processes.
- Idle Keep-Alive connections don‚Äôt block threads: Event MPM puts them aside until real work comes in.
- lower memory footprint, higher concurrency.
- allows multi-plexing and hence http2 .. 

### Architecture
- Parent process never directly accepts or processes client traffic. It only creates the listening socket, forks children, and supervises.
- Parent forks N child processes
- Each child processes listen to socket to accept connections in parallel from os tcp backlog queue
- Connection is held by the event loop within process
- Request processing is done in worker threads

### Configuration
- ServerLimit = 4
- ThreadsPerChild = 25
- AsyncRequestWorkerFactor = 2
- MaxRequestWorkers = 100


Result:
- 4 Processes
- 25 thread per process
- `2 √ó 25 = 50` Each process can track idle connections (keep-alive)
- 100 max concurrent active requests Apache can handle overall


Tip: every process in the 4 process, has by default one thread (listener thread) which listen for new connections, so actually each process has 26 thread


### How Event Allow Multi-Plexing and http2
Since connection is held in a process and you can run threads in same time to serve this request and return back data once any of threads finish its work (a typical multi-plexing http2)


### How Event is Better in Keep-Alive Magic
- Worker MPM: A worker thread stays stuck as long as the connection is open (even if idle).
- Event MPM: The worker thread is released after finishing the request. The event loop continues watching the idle connection.
  - If the client sends another request, a worker thread is reassigned.




## PHP-FPM

apache or nginx receive the request, and if it find the request want to request .php then it would send the request to fpm for execution


- PHP-FPM uses processes, not threads.
- every php execution is a new process



### Didnt you mention the problem with prefork is process based and this was the bottleneck?

yes, it does have same problem as prefork in terms of memory issue
- Each PHP-FPM execution is a full process, not a thread.
- Each execution consumes tens of MBs (30‚Äì50 MB or more depending on extensions and scripts).
- Under heavy PHP traffic, memory usage can grow quickly.
- bottleneck is not eliminated, but shifted and reduced:


but, its much better compared with what prefork was doing
- in prefork every request was a process. even if its asking for static files but in fpm its only php execution which is a process
- in prefork keep alive connection was holding a process. but in fpm its only php execution which is a process

## Issues

i can see two major issues with php-fpm that can be squeezed more if going for more performance

### Duplicate Work And Memory
every php execution has to boot up everything (classes autoload + configs + etc..) for every execution = (duplicate work) + (duplicate memory)

Trials To Solve this is by 
- Swoole
- Road Runner
- Laravel Octane

Problem here is that all php world have been building applications + packages .. 
assuming every execution = things will load up from scratch + execution ..

now if you say i want the loadedup to maintain .. what happens if a package store something globally in static variable or in a singleton thinking its just per execution .. because now with the new model your state will be globally shared with other executions as well.. which is very different model


### I/O work
when php is executing and it faces expensive i/o operation like slow query or slow api call.. process will stay there with its memory usage just stuck for the i/o to finish .. on a performance wise you dont want to keep waiting for i/o to finish and do something else till this i/o finish and this is something php doesnt support out of the box

nodejs nature is better here or you have to go with nodejs nature in php using some tools like reactphp
