# SOLID 
is a set of five design principles in object-oriented programming that help you write cleaner, more maintainable, and scalable code.


S — Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A class should have only one reason to change. Each class should focus on one job.


O — Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. You should be able to add new behavior without changing tested code.


L — Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes without breaking the program.
If class B extends A, you should be able to use B wherever A is expected.


I — Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they don’t use.
It’s better to have many small, focused interfaces than one big “fat” one.


D — Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.
High-level modules shouldn’t depend on low-level modules; both should depend on interfaces/contracts.



# When SOLID Feels Harder than a God Object

When I do SOLID, I feel like I’m adding more parts to the code, which makes it harder to understand the relations between classes.  Meanwhile, with smaller classes — even if they violate SRP, LSP, ISP — I can still understand them more easily.  
God objects are pretty straightforward.

## 😅 Why Does SOLID Feel Harder?

- More files, more indirection  
  - With a God object, you just open one file and see everything.  
  - With SOLID, you need to jump between multiple classes and interfaces.  

- Extra boilerplate  
  - Interfaces, small services, decorators — it looks like more code for the same result.  

- You’re still the only developer (sometimes)  
  - If you’re working solo or on a small project, a single "fat class" can feel easier to manage.

## 🚀 Why Is SOLID Still Valuable?

SOLID shines not in small codebases, but in growing systems:

- Change isolation → One team edits the “Mailer,” another edits the “UserService,” no merge conflicts.  
- Flexibility → Add a new payment gateway, logging strategy, or notification channel *without editing old code*.  
- Testability → Unit test smaller parts independently.  
- Extensibility → Special client rules don’t force you to fork the whole God object.  

---

## ⚖️ Balanced Approach
- For small projects or prototypes → A slightly fat class is fine. Don’t over-engineer.  
- For long-living systems (e.g., Laravel apps with multiple features, tenants, integrations) → Splitting code with SOLID pays off over time.  

---

## 💡 Practical Trick

Start with simple classes.  
When you notice:  
- One class changes too often for different reasons, or  
- You can’t unit test it without booting the whole system,  

👉 Then refactor using SOLID principles.
