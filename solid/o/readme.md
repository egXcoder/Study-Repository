# Openâ€“Closed Principle (OCP)

A class/module should be **open for extension** but **closed for modification**.

**Meaning:**  
When you want to add a new behavior, you **shouldn't edit existing, tested code** â€” instead, you **extend it**.

## ðŸš€ Why is it Useful?

- **Stability** â†’ Once a class works and is tested, you donâ€™t risk introducing bugs by modifying it every time a new requirement comes up.  
- **Extensibility** â†’ You can add new features by adding new classes or extending behavior, not by hacking existing ones.  
- **Scalability** â†’ Keeps the codebase cleaner as requirements grow, instead of one God-class with endless `if/else`.

---

## âœ¨ So, When Do You Modify a "Closed" Class?

You modify it for reasons that are **not about adding new features**:

- **Fix a bug** â†’ e.g., if `Circle::getArea()` is wrong, you fix it.  
- **Refactor** â†’ improve variable names or clean up the code without changing its behavior.  
- **Improve performance** â†’ optimize an algorithm in a way that doesnâ€™t change what it does.

## âœ… In Short

OCP makes your codebase **future-proof**.  
Instead of editing code, you can **plug in new behaviors like Lego blocks**.
