# Behavioral Design Patterns

define the ways in which objects collaborate and delegate responsibilities

## Why do we need behavioral patterns?



- Chain Of Responsibility: lets you pass a request along a chain of handlers
- Command: turns a request into an object.
- Iterator: provides a standard way to traverse a collection of objects without exposing its internal structure.
- Mediator: make colleagues not send messages to each other directly and instead rely on mediator
- Memento: save and restore its state
- Observer: subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about events
- State: letting an object change its behavior when its internal state changes
- Strategy: define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.
- Template Method: defines the skeleton (template) of an algorithm in a base class but lets subclasses override certain steps of the algorithm without changing its overall structure.
- Visitor: separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate.
