# NPM

npm is node package manager to manage packaging installations/activation etc..

nodejs as runtime environment used for frontend tooling (like compiling CSS/JS with Vite, Mix, or Webpack).

## Installation


NVM = Node Version Manager

- A tool that lets you install and switch between different versions of Node.js on your machine.
- Useful because different projects often need different Node versions.
- `nvm install 20 && nvm list`


FNM = Fast Node Manager

- the new tool and its alternative to nvm
- It is written in Rust, which helps with speed, efficiency, low startup overhead
- `fnm install 20 && fnm list`



- you can have multiple nodejs versions within your linux and you can switch between them per terminal
    - `fnm list` .. list available versions on your machine
    - `fnm default 22` .. set default.. so whenver you open new terminal this will be the chosen version
    - `fnm use 20` .. it will change nodejs to be 20 on this terminal
    - within project file, create a file .nvmrc and put 20 (this will hint that you project to be version 20)
    - `fnm use` will read the version from .nvmrc file and use it per terminal
    
    Tip: when you change nodejs version.. npm version auto switch to compatible version .. in practice â†’ installing Node gives you npm by default as nodejs bundled with npm, so most people treat them as a pair.
