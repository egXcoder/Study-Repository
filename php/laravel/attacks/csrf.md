# CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)


It‚Äôs an attack that send a request to a website without user consent.

## Scenario:

- Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre logged in to your bank‚Äôs website https://mybank.com .. notice: your browser stores a session cookie for mybank

- You then visit http://evil.com in another tab

- In Malicious Site `<img src="https://mybank.com/transfer?to=attacker&amount=1000" />` which Sends a Hidden Request .. 

- Browser automatically sends your request to mybank.com along with the session cookie

- If mybank.com‚Äôs transfer endpoint doesn‚Äôt verify authenticity, the request goes through. üí∏ Money transferred without you ever clicking anything on mybank.com.

## It‚Äôs because:
- Browsers automatically include cookies for the target site with every request.
- The site trusts those cookies as proof of authentication.
- The attacker exploits that trust.


## How To Prevent

### CSRF Tokens

Every form or state-changing request with your application includes a random secret token.

```html
<form method="POST" action="/transfer">
  <input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="ABC123XYZ">
  <input type="text" name="amount">
  <button>Send</button>
</form>
```

The server checks: Does the token match what was stored in the session? If not ‚Üí reject the request.

This prevents forged requests, since the attacker‚Äôs site can‚Äôt know the secret token.

CSRF Token is generated in start of each session as `_token=>asvzxbasseqwe123` and it regenerate whenever session regenerate .. when user first view there is a session and when he login session regenerate and when logout session regenerate etc..

Server send the token: 
- cookie `XSRF-TOKEN` so clients can use it 
- with php method `csrf_token()`

client send the token: 
- `_token` request parameter
- `X-CSRF-TOKEN` request header


### SameSite Cookies

Modern browsers support a cookie attribute called SameSite.

Set-Cookie: session=xyz; SameSite=Lax

This tells the browser: Don‚Äôt send this cookie with cross-site requests. This blocks CSRF attempts from external origins.

### Same Origin Policy and CORS

Same-Origin Policy (SOP): by default, browsers block JS from reading responses from different origins.

CORS: allows the server to say, ‚ÄúYes, this other origin is allowed to read my data.‚Äù

Request `Origin: https://evil.com` ..  

Response `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://evil.com` or `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`

Tip: browser considers each subdomain a different origin.

partially solve it because CORS dont block requests completely.. only JS reading the response is blocked. So CSRF can still succeed even if your CORS policy is strict.


### Use POST (Not GET) for State-Changing Actions

then malicious site can't do this <a href="/transfer?to=attacker&amount=1000">Transfer</a>

partially solve it, because malicious site can send ajax request with post method


### Check the Origin or Referer Header

Check the Origin or Referer Header

When a browser send a request it include header Origin: https://yourbank.com or Referer: https://yourbank.com/account

Partially solve it, because malicious site still can forgery the origin header while he is sending his request

```php

$origin = $_SERVER['HTTP_ORIGIN'] ?? $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'] ?? '';
if (!str_starts_with($origin, 'https://yourbank.com')) {
    http_response_code(403);
    exit('Invalid origin');
}

```
